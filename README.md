## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
2 to 3 APPS:
I love Instagram, Uber driver application and WhatsApp.

Instagram : Video rendering where you can stop or control the sound when scrolling through a list of new posts. Very safe compare to TiKTok in which it is not possible. The display of the chat system looks great.

WhatsApp: Chat system looks great. Taking video or a picture with WhatsApp perfect predefined settings of the camera without the need to do any setting. It makes it easy to send video and photos through the Chat system.

Uber driver mobile App: ETA and navigation system that allow the customers to know the estimated arrival time off the driver and follow on the map the exact or near real-time postion of the driver during a request or a delivery. Another feature that I like the most is the ability to show on the map the drivers around a customer when requesting a ride. 

IDEAL APP AND ITS FEATURES:
IOS geo-location app that will run as Uber ride and food delivery application. I will be happy to develop an app for drivers to serve taxi or ride-sharing and delivery. Customers will follow the drivers in nearly real time from the map. I want to develop my own IOS mobile application similar to Uber mobile app. The following are few of the features that I will implement: Customer registration, driver registration, restaurant registration, customer login, driver login, restaurant login, customer logout, driver log out, restaurant logout, payment methods, maps and navigation, communication systems such as sms, phone call and email, agreements etc.


## Notes

The first challenge for me is to run MacOS in Ubuntu KVM because I have never used MacOS Computer and I don't have money now to buy a new MacOS computer. The second is about the prework requirement description where we need to create click event listener for the background color button. It was really confusing using the plus sign and control. If press key was used for control in the sentence, it will be better to understand. Xcode or swift language syntax may be challenging for all beginners like me.
